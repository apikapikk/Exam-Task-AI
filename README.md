# Career Path Prediction: IPA or IPS

This project was created to fulfill the final assignment (UAS) for the Artificial Intelligence course.

## 🔍 Project Description

This simple AI-based system predicts whether a student is more suitable for the **IPA (Natural Sciences)** or **IPS (Social Sciences)** academic track based on their answers to a series of questions. The reasoning is implemented using a **rule-based (knowledge-based)** approach.

It simulates how a basic expert system can assist in educational guidance by applying fuzzy or logical rules to subjective inputs such as interests, strengths, and preferences.

## 🧠 Features

- Simple decision support system
- Rule-based reasoning (knowledge base)
- Yes/No questions to simulate input
- Score-based logic to determine result
- Built using JavaScript (client-side)
